    "   The dataset used will be Audit Data, which was collected by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India for the 2015-2016 year from the Auditor General Office of the CAG. The data features information from 777 different firms across 46 different cities and 14 different industry sectors. Auditing is the practice of examining businesses' financial records compared to their financial statements to ensure they are in compliance with India's accounting laws. The purpose of the project centers on the prevention of fraudulent data activity. In the long term the prediction could help the impact it may cause to the economy and individuals on that society.\n",
    " The question we will be trying to answer in this data analysis is: *“What’s the likelihood of an Indian firm being fraudulent?”*. "
